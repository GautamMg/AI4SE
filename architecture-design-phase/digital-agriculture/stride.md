| FieldOperator ↔ PathPlannerModule          | Spoofing / Tampering | Unauthorized user defines wrong plots or parameters; bad missions.     | OS-level user auth; mission templates stored with owner; parameter validation in CLI.         | Scripted CLI tests with invalid users/params; verify rejection and logs.                  | NFR-SEC-001, NFR-USA-001, ADR-002 |
| FieldOperator ↔ TransferModule             | Repudiation | Disputes about manual retries or cancellations; unclear audit trail.   | Structured logs with timestamp, user, and action in `EdgeDatabase`.                           | Functional tests that trigger retries and cancellations; verify audit entries.            | NFR-USE-003, FR-9, ADR-003  |
| TransferModule ↔ EdgeFileStore             | Tampering   | Corrupted or partially written image files uploaded to HPC.            | Checksums per batch; integrity validation (FR-10) before marking batch as complete.           | Corrupt files before upload; verify batch rejected and re-queued with clear error.        | FR-10, NFR-REL-002, ADR-004 |
| TransferModule ↔ TapisAPI (HTTPS over WAN) | Spoofing / Info Disclosure | Credentials or data intercepted; wrong endpoint used.                   | HTTPS with certificate validation; short-lived Tapis tokens; endpoint configured via signed config. | Integration tests with invalid certificates/URLs; verify failure and safe error logs.     | NFR-SEC-001, ADR-001        |
| AerialSystem ↔ OpenPass (manifest export)  | Tampering   | Malformed or malicious mission manifests executed by OpenPass.         | Strict schema for manifest format; validation step before export; versioned manifest schema.  | Provide invalid manifests and verify OpenPass rejection and local error capture.          | FR-3, NFR-USA-001, ADR-002  |
| TapisAPI ↔ HPCCluster (job execution)      | DoS / Elevation | Excessive or malformed job submissions impacting cluster availability. | Rate limiting in `TransferModule`; per-mission job templates; conservative default frequencies. | Load tests with many jobs; confirm throttling and cluster-side limits respected.          | NFR-SCA-001, NFR-REL-001, ADR-001 |
| TransferModule ↔ EdgeDatabase              | Tampering / Denial of Service | Broken metadata blocks retries, resumes, and dedup (FR-8, FR-11).      | Use SQLite transactions; schema-level constraints; periodic integrity checks and backups.     | Inject DB corruption and simulate restart; verify graceful error and recovery procedures. | NFR-REL-002, ADR-003        |
